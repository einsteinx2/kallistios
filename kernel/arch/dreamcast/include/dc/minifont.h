/** \file   dc/minifont.h
    \brief  Simple font drawing functions.

    This file provides support for utilizing the "Naomi" font that is included
    in the KOS source code (in the utils/minifont.h file). This was designed for
    use when you really just want a *very* simple font to draw with.

    Only ASCII characters are usable here. No other fancy encodings are
    supported, nor are any extended ASCII characters beyond the 7-bit range.
    Also, only 16-bit buffers (like what you would normally have for the
    framebuffer) are currently supported.
